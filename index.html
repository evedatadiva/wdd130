      <p>Hello, my name is Evelin. I am from Peru.  
        I like to watch movies, read books, ride a bike and walk. 
        I want to be a software development. It is my second semester!!. 
        The thing That I really like of BYU-Idaho is the way of learning and teaching.
        It is diferent like I experienced before. 
        The advantages that I see learning about web design are the possibilities that I can create web sites for myself.
        Personally I think that it is awesome. 
        I am taking this course, because months ago I created one online store for myself in Shopify. 
        So, I felt the desire to learn more about it. 
        I hope to learn about the structure and design of the web sites, optimize SEO and be self-sufficient creating. 
        I am member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was a child (five years old). 
        One of my favorite quotes is titled: ´Sunday Will Come´ by Joseph B. Wirthlin, and he said: 
        No matter our despair, no matter our sorrow, Sunday will come. In this life or the next, Sunday will come. 
        This quote helped me a lot in my mission and helps me a lot in my life. 
        Thanks.
